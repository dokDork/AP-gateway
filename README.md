# AP-proxy
The tool activates a proxy access point on the Linux machine on which it is activated, thus creating an AP that must be connected to the internet. All traffic passing through the access point can be analyzed or diverted to other proxies active on the Linux machine (such as burpSuite, mitmproxy, certmitm, or others).

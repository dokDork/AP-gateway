# AP-gateway
The tool activates an access point, on the Linux machine on which it is activated, that works like a gateway thus creating an AP that must be connected to the internet. All traffic passing through the access point can be analyzed or diverted to other proxies, by means of iptables, active on the Linux machine (such as burpSuite, mitmproxy, certmitm, or others).
